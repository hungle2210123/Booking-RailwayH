**Date:** 2025-06-26  
**Status:** ✅ **ALL ISSUES RESOLVED**  
**User Issues:** 
1. `'duplicate_report' is undefined` error
2. Deleted guests still appearing in Dashboard and Revenue Calendar

---

## 🚫 **PROBLEM ANALYSIS**

### **Issue 1: Template Error**
- **Error:** `'duplicate_report' is undefined`
- **Cause:** Template expects `duplicate_report` variable but backend wasn't providing it

### **Issue 2: Deleted Guests Still Visible**
- **Problem:** Deleted bookings appear in Dashboard notifications and Revenue Calendar
- **Root Cause:** SQL queries were loading ALL bookings, including deleted ones
- **Impact:** Revenue calculations and guest counts included deleted data

---

## ✅ **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. ✅ Fixed Template Error**

**Problem:** `duplicate_report` variable missing from template context

**Files Modified:**
- `/app_postgresql.py:301-314` - Added duplicate_report creation
- `/app_postgresql.py:424` - Added duplicate_report to template variables

```python
# Create duplicate report for template
duplicate_report = {
    'total_groups': duplicates.get('total_groups', 0),
    'total_duplicates': duplicates.get('total_duplicates', 0),
    'filtered_count': len(duplicate_booking_ids)
}
```

**Result:** ✅ No more template undefined errors

### **2. ✅ Fixed SQL Query to Exclude Deleted Bookings**

**Problem:** Main data loading query included deleted bookings

**File:** `/core/logic_postgresql.py:115`
```sql
-- BEFORE:
WHERE 1=1

-- AFTER:
WHERE b.booking_status != 'deleted'
```

**Impact:** 
- ✅ Dashboard no longer shows deleted guests in notifications
- ✅ Revenue Calendar excludes deleted bookings from calculations
- ✅ All booking lists now clean of deleted entries

### **3. ✅ Fixed Statistics Queries**

**Problem:** Count queries included deleted bookings in totals

**Files Modified:**
- `/core/database_service.py:429` - Fixed total bookings count
- `/core/models.py:319` - Fixed statistics bookings count

```python
# BEFORE:
total_bookings = Booking.query.count()
stats['bookings'] = Booking.query.count()

# AFTER:
total_bookings = Booking.query.filter(Booking.booking_status != 'deleted').count()
stats['bookings'] = Booking.query.filter(Booking.booking_status != 'deleted').count()
```

**Result:** ✅ Dashboard statistics exclude deleted bookings

## 🎯 **DATA FLOW IMPACT**

### **Before Fix:**
```
Delete Booking → booking_status = 'deleted' (soft delete)
                ↓
Load Data → SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE 1=1  (includes deleted)
                ↓
Dashboard → Shows deleted guests in notifications ❌
Calendar → Includes deleted bookings in revenue ❌
Statistics → Counts deleted bookings ❌
```

### **After Fix:**
```
Delete Booking → booking_status = 'deleted' (soft delete)
                ↓
Load Data → SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE booking_status != 'deleted'  (excludes deleted)
                ↓
Dashboard → Clean notifications, no deleted guests ✅
Calendar → Accurate revenue without deleted bookings ✅
Statistics → Correct counts excluding deleted ✅
```
