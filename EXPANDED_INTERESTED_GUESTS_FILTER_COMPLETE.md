**Date:** 2025-06-26  
**Status:** ✅ **FILTER LOGIC EXPANDED AS REQUESTED**  
**User Request:** *"Show all upcoming guests, not +7 days, and also guests who have not paid and checked out before the current day"*

---

## 🎯 **NEW FILTER LOGIC IMPLEMENTED**

### **✅ EXPANDED "Interested Guests" Filter**
**File:** `/app_postgresql.py:304-331`

```python
# EXPANDED FILTER: Show guests who need payment collection or management
payment_issue_mask = (
    (filtered_df['Số tiền đã thu'].fillna(0) == 0) |  # No money collected
    (filtered_df['Số tiền đã thu'].fillna(0) < filtered_df['Tổng thanh toán']) |  # Partial payment
    (~filtered_df['Người thu tiền'].isin(['LOC LE', 'THAO LE']))  # Invalid collector
)

interested_mask = (
    # Condition 1: All upcoming guests (future check-ins)
    (filtered_df['Check-in Date'].dt.date >= today) |
    
    # Condition 2: Current/past guests with payment issues who haven't checked out yet
    # (checked out after today OR haven't checked out yet)
    (
        payment_issue_mask &
        (filtered_df['Check-out Date'].dt.date >= today)
    )
)
```

## 🔍 **FILTER CRITERIA BREAKDOWN**

### **Default View Now Shows:**

#### **1. ✅ ALL Upcoming Guests (No 7-day limit)**
- **Previous:** Only guests checking in within next 7 days
- **NEW:** All guests with check-in date >= today (unlimited future)
- **Example:** Guests checking in today, tomorrow, next week, next month, etc.

#### **2. ✅ Current/Staying Guests with Payment Issues**
- **Criteria:** Guests who have payment issues AND haven't checked out yet
- **Payment Issues:**
  - No money collected (`Số tiền đã thu = 0`)
  - Partial payment (`Số tiền đã thu < Tổng thanh toán`)
  - Invalid collector (not LOC LE or THAO LE)
- **Stay Status:** Check-out date >= today (still staying or should have checked out)

---

## 📅 **PRACTICAL EXAMPLES**

### **Today = June 26th**

#### **✅ WILL SHOW (Interested Guests):**

**Upcoming Guests (All Future):**
- Guest A: Check-in June 27th (tomorrow)
- Guest B: Check-in July 5th (next week)  
- Guest C: Check-in August 15th (next month)
- Guest D: Check-in December 25th (distant future)

**Current/Staying Unpaid Guests:**
- Guest E: Checked in June 20th, checks out June 28th, unpaid ✅
- Guest F: Checked in June 25th, checks out June 27th, partial payment ✅
- Guest G: Checked in June 24th, checks out June 26th (today), unpaid ✅
- Guest H: Should have checked out June 25th but unpaid (overstaying) ✅

#### **❌ WILL NOT SHOW:**
- Guest I: Checked out June 25th, fully paid (completed)
- Guest J: Checked out June 24th, unpaid (already past checkout)
- Guest K: Checked in June 20th, checked out June 23rd (past and done)

---

## 🎯 **BUSINESS LOGIC EXPLANATION**

### **Why This Filter Makes Sense:**

#### **All Upcoming Guests:**
- **Staff need to prepare** for all future arrivals, not just next 7 days
- **Room management** requires knowing all scheduled check-ins
- **Payment follow-up** can be done for distant bookings too

#### **Current Unpaid Guests:**
- **Active revenue collection** for guests currently staying
- **Checkout management** for guests who should pay before leaving
- **Overstay tracking** for guests who exceeded checkout date without payment

---

## 🔄 **LOGICAL FLOW**

### **Filter Decision Tree:**
```
For each guest:
├── Is check-in date >= today?
│   ├── YES → SHOW (upcoming guest)
│   └── NO → Continue to next check
│
└── Does guest have payment issues?
    ├── YES → Is check-out date >= today?
    │   ├── YES → SHOW (current unpaid guest)
    │   └── NO → HIDE (past checkout, too late)
    └── NO → HIDE (payment complete)
```

---

## 📊 **DEBUG INFORMATION UPDATED**

### **Enhanced Logging:**
```python
print(f"🔍 EXPANDED INTERESTED GUESTS FILTER RESULTS:")
print(f"   📊 Total guests filtered: {before_count} → {after_count}")
print(f"   🏨 All upcoming guests: {upcoming_guests}")
print(f"   💰 Current/staying unpaid guests: {current_unpaid_guests}")
print(f"   📅 Focus: All future arrivals + current unpaid guests")
print(f"   🎯 Logic: Future check-ins OR (unpaid AND not checked out yet)")
```
